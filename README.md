# 2048 - Number Sliding game

## Vue + Vite + JS

### Instructions

You can slide the entire board by using the keyboard arrow keys. If two tiles with the same value slide into each other,
they will merge with a tile that has twice the value. You can win the game by creating a tile with the value 2048.

### Options

The user can select the number of rows, columns, and obstacles in the game by using the buttons at the top of the page.
If you make these changes, you must start a new game. Obstacles are black tiles that cannot move and cannot merge, the
player has to play around them to win.
